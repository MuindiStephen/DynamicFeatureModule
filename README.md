## Implementing Dynamic Feature Modules
- Dynamic feature modules are modules for separating features and resources from the base APK. Users can later download and install these modules on demand after theyâ€™ve already installed the app from Google Play. For example, we may have certain features that only a small percentage of users can access. For this, we can make the feature delivered to users only when they need it.
